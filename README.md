## Getting started with Git

Git and github can be an intimidating concept for beginners, but trust me, once you've gotten the hang of the basics, you'll see that it's not as hard as it looks. The method of contributing to this repo takes you through the standard process of contributing to open source, so it'll be useful practice for when you start contributing to those big projects! Here are some resources to help with learning git:

- This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc&t=904s) is a relatively short introduction to Git and its basics
- For those looking for a more in depth explanation, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) helps
- This [book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is from Git's website and its quite extensive. Some [videos](http://git-scm.com/videos) can also be found on the site too.

Between these and Google, you should be able to solve most issues you'll encounter. But if you are still facing problems, don't hesitate to [reach out](https://t.me/+2MO6mRp2PCEwODNk)
